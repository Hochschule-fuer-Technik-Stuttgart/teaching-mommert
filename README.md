# HFT Teaching

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks that I use in my teaching activities at the Stuttgart University of Applied Science (HFT).

The notebooks are optimized for running them in cloud computing
environments such as Binder or Google Colab (launchers are provided
for your convenience). Feel free to use and share these notebooks for
your own learning or teaching activities.
