# Classification

This directory contains tutorials related to classification tasks.

## LULC Machine Learning

This example showcases the use of traditional machine learning methods
for land-use/land-cover classification. Methods such as maximum
likelihood estimation, k-nearest neighbors and random forests are
introduced.
