# Classification

This directory contains tutorials related to classification tasks.

## LULC Machine Learning

This example showcases the use of traditional machine learning methods
for land-use/land-cover classification. Methods such as maximum
likelihood estimation, k-nearest neighbors and random forests are
introduced.


## LULC Deep Learning

This tutorial introduces the use of neural networks for pixel-wise
classification for land-use/land-cover classification.
