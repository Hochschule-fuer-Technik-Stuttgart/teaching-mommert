This repository contains 5 Sentinel-2 Level-2A (12 bands) images that
are part of the BigEarthNet Dataset (Sumbul et al. 2019,
https://bigearth.net/). The images in this dataset focus on coastal
areas.

The image data for each scene and band were upscaled to a common
ground sample distance of 10m per pixel using linear
interpolation. Furthermore, all bands of each scence were combined
into a single NumPy array and stored into separate .npy binary files.
Data processing was performed by Linus Scheibenreif, University of
St. Gallen.

The data can be easily read in with Python using the following code
snippet:

   import os
   import numpy as np

   data = []
   for filename in os.listdir('data/'):
       if filename.endswith('.npy'):
           data.append(np.load(open(os.path.join('data', filename), 'rb'),
	                       allow_pickle=True))
   data = np.array(data)

This repository also contains the file coastal_labels.json, which
contains polygons for labels grassland, forest, water and sand,
using the YOLO format.
